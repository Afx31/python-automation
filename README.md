# Python Automation
This repository will contain different Python scripts I'll create over time to use in my every day life activities.


## File Sorter (file-sorter.py)
As the name suggests, this script is to sort files. You can provide a ```src_dir``` for the source folder, along with a ```dest_dir_<new-folder-name>``` which will copy over the items from source to destination. This current config will delete the files from source once the move is complete.
